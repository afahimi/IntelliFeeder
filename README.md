Welcome to IntelliFeeder, crafted with both dogs and cats in mind. This innovative system ensures your pets are fed on time, every time, even when you're not around.

## Overview

Our solution includes a user-friendly web application that allows you to either feed your pet on-demand or set a daily feeding schedule. Customize it according to your pet's dietary needs - whether it's for your feline friend, your canine companion, or both! Each pet's feeding schedule is handled independently, granting you complete control over portion sizes, feeding times, and the number of meals served per day.

## Features

### Adjustable Settings

You can select between small, medium, and large portion sizes, and easily adjust the number of servings per day, as well as the timing of each meal.

### Feeding History

Our web app keeps track of each meal, recording the time food was dispensed for both cats and dogs. This way, you can always make sure your pet's meals are served on time, every time.

### Camera Feature

We've integrated a camera into our system to provide you with a real-time view of your pet during feeding times. Employing machine learning technology, the camera updates the image on the web app only when it detects a cat, dog, or a person.

This feature not only allows you to monitor if your pet is consuming their food but also provides you with a sense of comfort knowing your pet is eating and doing well, no matter where you are.

We hope this project simplifies pet care for you, ensuring your furry friends never miss a meal again.
